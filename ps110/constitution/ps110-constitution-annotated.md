## GWIA 2

*This Constitution was made with the knowledge that our region has an overwhelming majority of humans to zombies. It is important to ensure that humans and zombies are given equal rights and protections, in the event of future growth and assimilation of these communities.*

*“Citizen” as referred to in this document is any human or zombie living in the area to which this Constitution applies.*

*"Immune" as referred to in this document is any human living in the area to which this Constitution applies.*

*"Blue" as referred to in this document is any zombie living in the area to which this Constitution applies.*

*The following regions will be declared as one nation-state by the ratification of this Constitution: Baja, Cascadia, and GWIA.*

> *Rationales are in italics.*

## ARTICLE I: Structure

This Government shall have three branches: Judicial, Legislative, and Executive.

Each branch shall have checks and balances between each other to balance the power and responsibility.

The Judicial Branch shall oversee the laws that this Government creates.

The Executive Branch shall be the face of the nation and Commander in Chief.

The Legislative shall represent the Citizens and create laws.

> *We decided to have checks and balances in order for the branches not to have too much power over each other. For most major decisions, approval from one or both of the other branches is needed.*

## ARTICLE II: Judicial Branch

There shall be a Supreme Court as the highest court in this nation with details as follows:

i. There shall be 9 Justices appointed to the Supreme Court.

ii. There shall be at least one Blue Justice appointed to the Supreme Court.

iii. The requirements for becoming a Justice shall be:

      - The Justice shall have been a justice in a lower court for at least 10 years.
      - The Justice shall be at least 35 years of age and at most 65 years of age at time of appointment.

iv. The Justice shall serve until death, resignation, retirement, or removal.

> *A supreme court justice must have at least 10 years of experience because it helps them make rational decisions. They must be between ages 35-65 because older people may not be the best representative of future generations, and if they are too young they may not have the experience. They should be appointed by the people because they serve the people. The term limits ensure that justices can interpret the law without any political or career concerns. They are given the powers as checks over the Legislative and Executive branches.*

## ARTICLE III: Legislative Branch

There shall be a Assembly consisting of Representatives detailed as follows:

i. Each Representative in the Assembly shall represent 10,000 Citizens as detailed in Article V.

ii. The Assembly shall be granted the power to:

      - Declare war
      - Manage the budget
      - Approve executive branch suggestions
      - Draft and propose laws to be approved by the other branches
      - Veto Executive Orders with a majority vote
      - Impeach a Supreme Court Justice with a majority vote
      - Impeach the President with a majority vote

iii. The requirements for becoming a Representative shall be:

      - The Representative shall be at least 30 years of age and at most 60 years of age at time of election.
      - The Representative shall have experience in civil government prior to election.

iv. Each Representative shall have a term limit of 4 years.

> *We think that they need a certain amount of time in the government in order to ensure they are experienced. We think that the age limit of 60 is reasonable because older people may not be the best representative of the average citizen. We think that each person represented in the Assembly should represent 10,000 citizens, this allows the legislature to grow and shrink with the needs of the population. Since times are uncertain we feel this is a good idea. We gave the legislative branch these powers in order to have checks and balances on the other branches of government, while having their own checks as well.*

## ARTICLE IV: Executive Branch

There shall be a President detailed as follows:

i. The President shall have be granted to power to:

      - Make treaties with foreign entities, subject to approval by the Assembly
      - Represent the Nation with other world leaders
      - Commands the military
      - Create executive orders

ii. The requirements for becoming President shall be:

      - The President shall be a natural-born Citizen
      - The President shall be at least 30 years of age and at most 60 years of age at time of election.
      - The President shall not have served as President more than once before.
      - The President shall have experience in civil government prior to election.

> *The president must be 30-60 years old because old people shouldn’t decide what the next generation has to do, and if they are too young they may not have the experience. We gave them only 2 term limits because if it is over then it might feel like a monarchy/dictator rather than a president. We gave them these powers because we believe that the president should be the face of the country rather than make all decisions for the country because if they do they might become power-hungry or corrupt.*

## ARTICLE V: Suffrage & Representation

i. Judicial Branch

      - Potential candidates shall be selected by the current President.
      - The Assembly shall choose the new Justice from the candidates by popular vote.
      - There shall be at least one Blue Justice on the Court at all times.

> *We believe that the citizens of the country may not have enough information on candidates for the supreme court to choose the best option so their representatives in the legislature will vote for them. Having at least one zombie in the supreme court gives the zombies fair representation.*

ii. Legislative Branch

      - There shall be 1 Representative for every 10,000 Citizens in each area, rounded up. At the time of writing this Constitution, this gives the following makeup of Representatives:
        - 56 Immunes, 5 Blues from Baja
        - 72 Immunes, 6 Blues from Cascadia
        - 32 Immunes, 1 Blue from GWIA

      - The Representatives shall be voted into office by the citizens of the region they represent by popular vote.
      - Votes shall be counted at local polling stations. Once postal infrastructure is deemed sufficient, mail-in ballots shall also be available.

> *We believe that these would all be a proportional representation of the entire country. We think by voting this way it would lead to fair representation and it wouldn’t be easy to corrupt. Proportional representation makes sense in a society where things are uncertain and ever-changing.*

iii. Executive Branch

      - The President shall be elected by popular vote by all Citizens in all regions.
      - Votes shall be counted at local polling stations. Once postal infrastructure is deemed sufficient, mail-in ballots shall also be available.

> *We believe that the citizens should be able to choose their president rather than the assembly or the supreme court because the president is the face of the people as well. We think it shouldn’t be mandatory that a zombie should be president because they are still represented in the assembly and even the supreme court.*

## ARTICLE VI: Amendments

This Constitution shall be able to be amended. An amendment to this Constitution shall require a two-thirds majority in the Assembly to pass and a fifty-percent approval of top-level regional governments to pass.

> *An amendment to this constitution is a larger change and can have a larger effect than a normal law, so the process of approving and ratifying the amendment should have a higher target of approval.*
