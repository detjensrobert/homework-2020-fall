# GWIA 2 Bill Of Rights

This bill of rights was made with the knowledge that the region has an overwhelming majority of humans to zombies. The humans have expressed their desire to remain segregated from the zombies. However, it is important to ensure that humans and zombies are given equal rights and protections, in the event of future assimilation of these communities.

“Citizen” as referred to in this document refers to any human or zombie living in the area to which this constitution applies.
