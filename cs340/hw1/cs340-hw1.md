### Problem 2: Research Facility

Assumptions:

- Labs are housed within a facility.
- The facility has a common storeroom for all labs to use.
- A chemist can only work at one facility.
- Borrowing equiment does not need the project it was used on recorded.
- The facility does not need any information about itself stored, e.g. address

### Problem 3: DBMS vs. standard files

Database systems provide many safety and security features compared to normal files, but can tell at the expense of complexity and speed. Database systems provide methods to reduce redundancy and consolidate repeated data into a central lies location they also provide finer control of what permissions a user has. Databases commonly have built-in backup and restore systems for data recovery and safety. They also provide mechanisms to restrict the types of stored data and checks to verify the integrity of data.

A database also handles concurrency problems, e.g. data corruption from simultaneous writes. Mirroring and other types of replication are available to load balance a large number of connections. A normal file would have a significantly higher risk of losing or corrupting data from simultaneous accesses.

Regular OS files, on the other hand, can be much faster to access than a database as there is no overhead from the database system. Additionally, files can be human readable and writable. While file systems do provide mechanisms to restrict access to files, these rules are more coarse and may not provide the desired level of access control as compared to a database's permissions.

#### Examples of when to use a database:

- complex structures with multiple entities that depend on each other
- data that needs to be backed up
- dealing with requests from multiple sources
- restricting access to secure information

#### Examples of when to use a normal file:

- configuration files
- human-readable logs
- low-power or embedded devices with limited resources
- single-user accesses
