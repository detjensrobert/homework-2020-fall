### Problem 3: Constraints

| Primary key                                        | In table       |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| `Student_number`                                   | `STUDENT`      |
| `Course_number`                                    | `COURSE`       |
| `Section_identifier`                               | `SECTION`      |
| `Student_number` and `Section_identifier` together | `GRADE_REPORT` |
| `Prequisite_number`                                | `PREREQUISITE` |

| Foreign key           | In table       | Points to |
|-----------------------|----------------|-----------|
| `Course_number`       | `SECTION`      | `COURSE`  |
| `Student_number`      | `GRADE_REPORT` | `STUDENT` |
| `Section_Identifier`  | `GRADE_REPORT` | `SECTION` |
| `Course_number`       | `PREREQUISITE` | `COURSE`  |
| `Prerequisite_number` | `PREREQUISITE` | `COURSE`  |

Operations:

- `Insert < 150, ‘CS162’, 'Fall', 2020, ‘Smith’ > into SECTION`

  Fails due to referential integrity. `CS162` is not a valid foreign key as there is no course in `COURSE` with that key to reference.

  Fails due to domain constraints. `2020` is not a valid entry for the Year field. *(Assuming from existing data this field only accepts 2-digit years.)*

- `Delete < 17, 112, 'B'> from GRADE_REPORT`

  Succeeds. There are no foreign keys pointing to this tuple, so referential integrity is satsfied.

- `Insert < 'CS3380', 'CS3320’> into PREREQUISITE`

  Fails due to key constraints. The primary key(s) of the new tuple already exist in the table.

- `Modify the Course_number of the SECTION tuple with Section_identifier 85 to 'MATH2444'`

  Fails due to referential integrity. `MATH2444` is not a valid foreign key as there is no course in `COURSE` with that key to reference.
