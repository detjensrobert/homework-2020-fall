### 1. Construct an NFA with three states that accepts the language *L*.

### 2. Suppose that a bank only permits passwords that are strings from the alphabet `[abcd123!?$]`, etc. Construct a NFA/DFA for L.

### 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Construct a DFA M that accepts a base-10 number if it is divisible by 3.

### 4. For the DFA M below, give its formal definition as a quintuple. Verbally describe the language, L(M), accepted by M.

(Indented for clarity.)

```js
M = (
  {q0,q1,q2,q3},
  {0,1},
  {
    δ(q0, 0) = q1
    δ(q0, 1) = q3
    δ(q1, 0) = q1
    δ(q1, 1) = q2
    δ(q2, 0) = q2
    δ(q2, 1) = q2
    δ(q3, 0) = q1
    δ(q3, 1) = q3
  },
  q0,
  {q1,q3}
)
```

### 5. Prove that the class of regular languages is closed under complementation. I.E. if L is a regular language then L*bar* is also a regular language.

If L is a regular language, there is a DFA M that accepts L.
If L*bar* is a regular language, there is a DFA M*bar* that accepts L*bar*.
To create M*bar*, invert all states in M; i.e. turn all regular/non-final states into final states, and all final states into non-final states.
All inputs previously accepted by M--stopped on a final state--will now stop on a non-final state and be rejected, and vice-versa.
