### 1. Convert the grammar below to CNF. Show your steps.

\lstset{
  xleftmargin=2em,
  literate={->}{$\rightarrow$}{2}
           {lambda}{$\lambda$}{1}
           {delta}{$\delta$}{1}
}

\begin{lstlisting}
S -> ABC | aBB
A -> BAA | C
B -> BB | b | lambda
C -> CD | a
D -> Da | abD
\end{lstlisting}

Lambda removal:

\begin{lstlisting}
S -> ABC | aBB | AC | aB | a
A -> BAA | C | AA
B -> BB | B | b
C -> CD | a
D -> Da | abD
\end{lstlisting}

Unit removal:

\begin{lstlisting}
S -> ABC | aBB | AC | aB | a
A -> BAA | AA | CD | a
B -> BB | b
C -> CD | a
D -> Da | abD
\end{lstlisting}

Useless removal:

\begin{lstlisting}
S -> ABC | aBB | AC | aB | a
A -> BAA | AA | a
B -> BB | b
C -> a
\end{lstlisting}

Chomsky conversion:

\begin{lstlisting}
S -> AD1 | CD2 | AC | a | CB
D1 -> BC
D2 -> BB
A -> BD3 | AA | a
D3 -> AA
B -> BB | b
C -> a
\end{lstlisting}

Exportion:

\begin{lstlisting}
S -> AC | AD | CB | CE | a
A -> AA | BF | a
B -> BB | b
C -> a
D -> BC
E -> BB
F -> AA
\end{lstlisting}

$\pagebreak$

### 2. Consider the CNF grammar below. Use CYK to determine if the strings $w_1 = 10112$ and $w_2 = 00011$ are in the language $L(G)$.

\begin{lstlisting}
S -> BB | AD | CA
A -> AA | 0
B -> BB | AB | 1
C -> AC | DC | 2
D -> DD | 1
\end{lstlisting}

#### $w_1 = 10112$:

|     |             |     |       |   |
|-----|-------------|-----|-------|---|
| B,D | $\emptyset$ | S,B | S,B   | C |
|     | A           | S,B | S,B   | C |
|     |             | B,D | S,B,D | C |
|     |             |     | B,D   | C |
|     |             |     |       | C |

Top right states do not include the start state $S$, so $w_2$ is not in $L(G)$.

#### $w_2 = 00011$:

|   |   |   |     |       |
|---|---|---|-----|-------|
| A | A | A | S,B | S,B   |
|   | A | A | S,B | S,B   |
|   |   | A | S,B | S,B   |
|   |   |   | B,D | S,B,D |
|   |   |   |     | B,D   |

Top right states include the start state $S$, so $w_2$ is in $L(G)$.

$$\Tree [.S [.A [.A 0 ] [.A [.A 0 ] [.A 0 ] ] ] [.D [.D 1 ] [.D 1 ] ] ]$$

### 3. Construct NPDAs that accept the following languages on $\Sigma = \{a, b\}$. Include a description of how it works, the formal definition, and the JFLAP transition graph.

**a. $L = \{ a^{2n}b^n : n \geq 0 \}$**

Formal definition: $M = (\{q0, q1, q2, q3\}, \{a, b\}, \{A, Z\}, \delta, q0, Z, q3)$ where $\delta$ is as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
  delta(q0, lambda, Z) = {(q3, Z)}
  delta(q0, a, lambda) = {(q1, A)}
  delta(q0, b, A) = {(q2, lambda)}
  delta(q1, a, lambda) = {(q0, lambda)}
  delta(q2, b, A) = {(q2, lambda)}
  delta(q2, lambda, Z) = {(q3, Z)}
\end{lstlisting}

This NDFA pushes an $A$ onto the stack for every 2 `a`s of input. Once all of the `a`s have been consumed and it has been an even number of `a`s, an $A$ is then removed from the stack for every `b`. Once all `b`s have been consumed and there is an empty stack, it moves to the final state to accept. To accept the case where $n = 0$, if the stack is empty at the initial state and all input has been consumed (a situation only satisfied by an empty input), it moves to the final state to accept.

**b. $L = \{ w : n_a(w) = 2n_b(w)) \}$**

Formal definition: $M = (\{q0, q1, q2\}, \{a, b\}, \{A, B, Z\}, \delta, q0, Z, q2)$ where $\delta$ is as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
delta(q0, a, B) = {(q0, lambda)}
delta(q0, a, lambda) = {(q0, A)}
delta(q0, b, lambda) = {(q1, B)}
delta(q0, b, A) = {(q1, lambda)}
delta(q1, lambda, lambda) = {(q0, B)}
delta(q1, lambda, A) = {(q0, lambda)}
delta(q0, lambda, Z) = {(q2, Z)}
\end{lstlisting}

![Transition Graph](https://i.imgur.com/tFjVzPB.png){ height=300px }

This NPDA either pushes an $A$ onto or pops a $B$ off of the stack for each `a` in the input. For `b`s, two $B$s are pushed or two $A$s are popped. The dual alphabet is needed here in contrast to 3.b as here `b`s can be encountered before `a`s and as such $A$s are not guaranteed to exist on the stack for a `b` to pop off. If the stack is empty once all input has been consumed, the language condition has been satisfied and the input can be accepted.
