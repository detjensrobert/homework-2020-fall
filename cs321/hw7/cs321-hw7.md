## 1. Design single-tape Turing machines that accept the following languages using JFLAP:

### a. $L_2 = \{ w : n_a(w) = n_b(w) : w \in \{ a, b \}^+ \}$

This Turing machine alternates between replacing $a$s and $b$s with $V$ (for Visited). If after replacing a $b$, the entire tape has been visited and this is a valid input.

### b. $L_3 = \{ ww : w \in \{ a, b \}^+ \}$

There are 3 "modules" to this Turing machine:

- The first module finds the middle of the input by replacing the outer-most input character ($a$ or $b$) with an internal equivalent ($A$ or $B$). This "peels" away each side until all characters have been replaced, and the cursor is now in the middle.
- The second module inserts an $M$ (for Middle) at the current location and shifts all following characters right one to make room.
- The third module bounces between the start of the input and the end of the middle and consumes a character from each half as long as they are the same. If the entire input has been consumed successfully, it is a valid input.

## 2. Design Turing Machines using JFLAP to compute the following functions for $x$ and $y$ positive integers represented in unary.The value $f(x)$ or $f(x,y)$ represented in unary should be on the tape surrounded by blanks after the calculation.

### a. $f(x,y) = \{ x - y \text{ if } x > y \text{ otherwise } 0 \}$

This Turing machine repeatedly tries to remove a `1` from each side of the input. If there are no `1`s left after the dash, remove the dash and accept the remainder. If there are no 1s preceding the dash, remove everything and write and accept a `0`.

### b. $f(x) = x \text{ mod } 5$

This Turing machine steps through 5 `1`s at a time. If there are less than 5 present, accept the input. If 5 are present, remove those 5 and repeat if there is still input left. If there are not any `1`s left, write `0` and accept.
