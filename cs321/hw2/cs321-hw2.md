### 1. Given an NFA $M$ with the transition graph shown below:

- **a. Give a regular expression $r$ such that $L(r) = L(M)$**

  $r =$ `((01)*) + (11*0)`

- **b. Construct a regular grammar $G$ such that $L(G) = L(M)$**

  $G = (V, T, S, P)$

  $V = \{S, A, B\}$

  $T = \{0, 1\}$

  $S = S$

  $P =$

\lstset{
  xleftmargin=4em,
  literate={->}{$\rightarrow$}{2}
           {lambda}{$\lambda$}{1}
}

\begin{lstlisting}
S -> 01A | 1B
A -> 01A | lambda
B -> 1B  | 0
\end{lstlisting}

### 2. Given the regular grammar $G = (V, T, S, P)$ where $V = \{A, B, C, S\}$, $T = \{a, b\}$ and productions $P$ defined below:

- **a. Construct an NFA $M$ such that $L(M) = L(G)$**

- **b. Give a regular expression $r$ such that $L(r) = L(G)$**

  $r =$ `(aa*) + (b(bba)*a)`

### 3. Suppose that a bank only permits passwords that are strings from the alphabet $\Sigma = \{a, b, c, d, e, 1, 2, 3\}$ that follow the rules:

$r =$ `(a+b+c+d+e)(a+b+c+d+e+1+2+3)(a+b+c+d+e+1+2+3)(a+b+c+d+e+1+2+3)(a+b+c+d+e+1+2+3)*(1+2+3)(1+2+3)`

### 4. Prove that if $L$ is a regular language then $L^R$ is a regular language.

Since $R$ is a regular language, there is a DFA $D$ that will accept $R$.
Ensure there is a single final/accept state by adding a lambda transition from all final states to a new final state, and make the new final state into the only final state.
Reverse the direction of all transitions, turn the final state into the initial state, and turn the initial state into a final state.

This new NFA $D^R$ will accept the language $L^R$, and as $L^R$ can be accepted by a NFA it is a regular language.
