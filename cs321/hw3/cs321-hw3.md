### Question 1: $L = \{ 0^n1^k : k \leq n \leq 2k \}$

Assume that $L$ is a regular language.

$L$ is infinite, so apply the Pumping Lemma to prove that it is regular.

Let $m$ be the integer for the Pumping Lemma where $m \ge 0$.

For string $w$ in $L$, $w = 0^{n}1^{m+k}$.

For string $w$, define substrings $x$, $y$, $z$ such that $xyz = w$, $|xy| \leq m$, and $|y| \geq 1$.

- $x = 0^a$
- $y = 0^{n-a}$
- $z = 1^{m+k}$

Therefore, $xy^iz \in L$ for $i = 4 * (m+k)$.

However, this contradicts the $k \leq n \leq 2k$ constraint for $L$, as $4*(m+k)$ is larger than $2*(m+k)$.

Therefore, by contradiction of the Pumping Lemma, $L$ is not a regular language.

### Question 2: $L = \{ a^n : n = k^2 \text{ for some } k \geq 0 \}$

Assume that $L$ is a regular language.

$L$ is infinite, so apply the Pumping Lemma to prove that it is regular.

Let $m$ be the integer for the Pumping Lemma where $m \ge 0$.

For string $w$ in $L$, $w = a^{m+n}$.

For string $w$, define substrings $x$, $y$, $z$ such that $xyz = w$, $|xy| \leq m$, and $|y| \geq 1$.

- $x = a$
- $y = a$
- $z = a^{m+k-2}$

Therefore, $xy^iz \in L$ for $i = 2$.

However, this contradicts the $n = k^2$ constraint for $L$, as $\sqrt{m+k+1}$ is not guaranteed to be an integer for all possible values of $m$.

Therefore, by contradiction of the Pumping Lemma, $L$ is not a regular language.

### Question 3: $L = \{ w : n_0(w) \le n_1(w), w \in \{ 0, 1 \}^* \}$

Assume that $L$ is a regular language.

As regular languages are closed under complement, $L \cap L(0^*1^*)$ is a regular language as both $L$ and $L(0^*1^*)$ are regular.

However, $L \cap L(0^*1^*) = \{ 0^n1^n \}$, which is not a regular language.

Therefore, this contradiction implies that $L$ is not a regular language.
