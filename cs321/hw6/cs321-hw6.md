### 1. $L_1 = \{ 0^n 1^n : n = 2^m \}$

Assume that $L$ is a context-free language.

$L$ is infinite, so apply the Pumping Lemma to prove that it is context-free.

Let $m$ be the "magic number" for the Pumping Lemma.

For a string $w$ in $L$, $w = 0^{2^m} 1^{2^m}$.

For the string $w$, define substrings $u, v, x, y, z$ such that $w = uvxyz$, $|vxy| \leq m$, and $|vy| > 1$.

There are 3 cases:

1. $vxy$ is within $0^n$

   Pick some $k \geq 1$ to pump $m$ with.

   $uv^2xy^2z = 0^{2^m+k} 1^{2^m} \notin L$.

   Contradiction!

2. $vxy$ is within $1^n$

   Similar to Case 1.

3. $vxy$ overlaps both $0^n$ and $1^n$

   1. Possibility 1: $v$ is only $0$, $y$ is only $1$

      Pick some $k_1 + k_2 \geq 1$ to pump $m$ with.

      $uv^2xy^2z = 0^{2^m+k_1} 1^{2^m+k_2} \notin L$.

      Contradiction!

   2. Possibility 2: $v$ has $0$ and $1$, $y$ is only $1$

      Pick some $k_1 + k_2 + k \geq 1$ to pump $m$ with.

      $uv^2xy^2z = 0^{2^m} 1^{k_1} 0^{k_2} 1^{2^m+k} \notin L$.

      Contradiction!

   3. Possibility 3: $v$ is only $0$, $y$ has $0$ and $1$

      Similar to Case 3.2.

### 2. $L_2 = \{ a^n b^n c^j : n \leq j \}$

Assume that $L$ is a context-free language.

$L$ is infinite, so apply the Pumping Lemma to prove that it is context-free.

Let $m$ be the "magic number" for the Pumping Lemma.

For a string $w$ in $L$, $w = a^m b^m c^m$.

For the string $w$, define substrings $u, v, x, y, z$ such that $w = uvxyz$, $|vxy| \leq m$, and $|vy| > 1$.

There are 5 cases:

1. $v$ contains $a$, $y$ contains $a$, $b$, and $c$.

   Pick some $k_1 + k_2 \geq 1$ to pump $m$ with.

   $uv^2xy^2z = a^m a^{k_1} b^m c^m b^{k_1} c^{k_2} \notin L$

   Contradiction!

2. $v$ contains $a$, $y$ contains $b$ and $c$.

   Pick some $k_1 + k_2 \geq 1$ to pump $m$ with.

   $uv^2xy^2z = a^m b^m c^m b^{k_1} c^{k_2} \notin L$

   Contradiction!

3. $v$ contains $a$ and $b$, $y$ contains $b$ and $c$.

   Pick some $k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + k_4 \geq 1$ to pump $m$ with.

   $uv^2xy^2z = a^m b^m a^{k_1} b^{k_2+m} c^m b^{k_3} c^{k_4} \notin L$

   Contradiction!

4. $v$ contains $a$ and $b$, $y$ contains $c$.

   Pick some $k_1 + k_2 \geq 1$ to pump $m$ with.

   $uv^2xy^2z = a^m b^m a^{k_1} b^{k_2} c^{m+k} \notin L$

   Contradiction!

5. $v$ contains $a$, $b$, and $c$, $y$ contains $c$.

   Pick some $k_1 + k_2 + k_3 \geq 1$ to pump $m$ with.

   $uv^2xy^2z = a^m b^m a^{k_1} b^{k_2} c^{k_3} c^m \notin L$

   Contradiction!

### 3. $L_3 = \{ w : w \in \{ a, b, c \}, n_a(w) > n_b(w) > n_b(w) \}$

Assume that $L$ is a context-free language.

$L$ is infinite, so apply the Pumping Lemma to prove that it is context-free.

Let $m$ be the "magic number" for the Pumping Lemma.

For a string $w$ in $L$, $w = 0^{2^m} 1^{2^m}$.

For the string $w$, define substrings $u, v, x, y, z$ such that $w = uvxyz$, $|vxy| \leq m$, and $|vy| > 1$.

### 4. Prove that the family of context-free languages is closed under reversal.

Let $L$ be some context-free language.

As $L$ is a context-free language, there is some context-free grammar $G$ that accepts $L$.

Reverse all all production rules in $G$ to create a new grammar $G_R$.

$G_R$ is a valid context-free grammar that accepts the language $L_R$.

Therefore, all context-free languages are closed under reversal.
