## Part 1: Describing the relationship between your two variables

### 1a. Graphically: Make a scatterplot of the relationship between ST314 student midterm grades and final exam grades. Paste your plot. Describe in context the relationship from the scatterplot. Include strength, direction, form, and outliers (if any).

There is a moderately weak positive linear relationship between the midterm and final grades. There are some outliers who scored better on the midterm than they did on the final, which may mean that the final is harder than the midterm.

### 1b. Numerically: Calculate the correlation coefficient $r$. Describe in context the strength of the relationship based on your value.

$r = 0.6363368$. This falls under "moderate positive correlation".

This suggests that students are generally doing about the same on the final as they are on the midterm, but there is some variance.

## Part 2: Calculate the Least Square Regression Line (Model) and Check Conditions for Inference

### 2a. Using R, calculate the least squares regression line that predicts final exam scores from midterm exam scores for ST314 students. Paste the R output for the model summary. State the least squares regression line (model).

```R
> summary(lm(Final~Midterm))

Call:
lm(formula = Final ~ Midterm)

Residuals:
     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max
-117.571  -13.617    1.962   16.059   68.671

Coefficients:

Multiple R-squared:  0.4049,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.4042

```

Least squares regression model: $\hat{y} = 75.49269 + 0.62217x$

### 2b. Plot the residuals for the model. Include a reference line at 0. Paste your plot. Check the linearity, normality and constant variation conditions using the residual plot. State why each condition is met or why it is not met.

The relationship is linear, as there is no U-shape or curvature in this graph.

The responses do vary normally about the regression line, as there is random scatter on both sides of the line.

The reponses are not constantly varied, since the scatter distance from the reference line is not contstant for all $x$. The scatter decreases for larger $x$ values.

### 2c. Using your linear model, predict what the final score would be for a student who received an 85% grade on the midterm, on average.

$$
\hat{y} = 75.49269 + 0.62217x = 75.49269 + 0.62217(0.85) = 76.0215345 = \bold{76\%}
$$
