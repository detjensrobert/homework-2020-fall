## Part 1

The variable combined carbon dioxide emissions, or CombCO2, represents the combined city and highway carbon dioxide emissions for vehicles sold in the US.

### a. Make a histogram of this variable. What are the values of $\mu$ and $\sigma$? How large is the population? Paste the histogram and give a brief description of the population data.

$\mu = 399.8717$, $\sigma = 89.82545$

$\pagebreak$

### b. Take a random sample of size 45 from the population. From your sample, calculate the sample statistics, $\bar{x}$ and $s$. Make a histogram of carbon dioxide emissions for the sample of 45 vehicles. Paste the histogram. Make a brief description of the sampled data. Does it look much like the population?

$\bar{x} = 400.0444$, $s = 92.0948$

### c. Use $\bar{x}$, your sampled mean, from (Part 1b) and your population standard deviation $\sigma$ (Part 1a), to calculate the 90% confidence interval (CI) for $\mu_{CO2}$. Show work! Does the interval include the true population mean for fuel efficiency?

$$CI = \bar{x} \pm Z_{\alpha/2} * \sigma_{\bar{x}}
= 400.0444 \pm 1.645 * \frac{89.82545}{\sqrt{45}}
= 400.0444 \pm 22.02719$$
$$\bold{\textbf{Confidence interval: } (378.0172, 422.0716)}$$

True mean: 399.8717. This is indeed included within the confidence interval.

### d. There are 220 students this term completing this same assignment. Assuming they calculated the CI correctly, how many students should we expect to have an interval that does not contain the true mean?

With a 90% confidence interval, we expect 90% of all random samples to contain the true mean of the dataset. Therefore, 10% or 22 students should have a CI that does not contain the true mean.

## Part 2

Suppose we want to see whether our sampled data from Part 1 will reject the true value of the population mean. Set up a hypothesis test where the claimed average is the actual average carbon dioxide emissions value we found in part 1a.

$$H_0:\mu = \mu_{CO2}$$
$$H_a:\mu \neq \mu_{CO2}$$

### a. Before performing the hypothesis test, can we anticipate the outcome? Will we most likely fail to reject or reject the null? Why?

I think that the sample data from Part 1 will fail to reject the null hypothesis. The true mean is inside the confidence interval and the sample mean is very close to the true mean as well. This has be believe that the sample data is very represtable of the dataset and will not reject the null hypothesis.

### b. Use $\bar{x}$, your sampled mean from (Part 1b), and your population standard deviation $\sigma$ (Part 1a), to perform a one-sample z test for the above hypotheses, where $\mu_{CO2}$ is the population mean. Use a significance level of $\alpha = 0.10$. Show your work for the test statistic and provide a p-value.

$$z
= \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_{0}}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}
= \frac{400.0444 - 399.8717}{89.82545 / \sqrt{45}}
= \frac{0.1727}{13.39039}
= 0.01289731
$$
$$\bold{z = 0.01}$$

$$\text{Double-sided z-table lookup for }0.01 = 0.4960 + (1 - 0.5040)$$
$$\bold{p = 0.992}$$

For the sample data, $p > 0.10$ and as a result provides extremely weak evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

### c. Make a four-part conclusion based on your results. This should include:

- A statement in terms of the evidence in favor of the alternative.
- Whether we should reject the null hypothesis.
- A point and interval estimate.
- Context.

After performing a two-tailed hypothesis test, there is not convincing evidence that the sample data does not represent the true value of the population mean. The null hypothesis that the population mean is 399.8717 failed to be rejected at a significance level of 0.01, with z-stat of 0.01 and p-value of 0.992. The sample data estimates the average population mean to be 400.0444 with a 90% confidence interval of 378.0172 to 422.0716.

### d. If the interval in part 1c does not contain the true parameter, why will the same sampled data also reject the true null using the hypothesis test?

## Part 3

Consider your random sample from Part 1b, provided it was obtained randomly, your sample mean and standard deviation values are not static. That is, if we were to take a different sample, these values would change. We discussed this notion when we learned about repeated sampling and sampling distributions. The one sample z test is dependent on these values. Results for the test will vary.

Sample 10000 random samples of size 45 from the population and check out three different things: the sampling distribution for the sample means, the distribution of z test statistics and the distribution of p-values.

### a. According to the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), what is the distribution of the sample means? Include the theoretical mean and standard deviation values. Show work.

The sample data will have a normal distribution according to the CLT.

$$\mu_{\bar{x}} = 399.8717$$
$$\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{89.825457}{\sqrt{45}} = 13.39039$$

### b.  Create a histogram of the sampling distribution for $\bar{x}$. Paste your plot. Do the simulated sample means support the Central Limit Theorem? Compare the shape, mean and standard deviation of the simulated sample means to what they should be theoretically.

Calculated mean: 399.881 | Calculated stdev: 13.08053

### c. Create a histogram of your z test statistics. Paste your plot. What type of distribution will model these test statistics? 

![Sampling Z-Test Histogram](https://i.imgur.com/3W0ujel.png){ height=250px }

The Z-tests have a standard normal distribution, as the mean (0.004915748) and standard deviation of this data (0.9788765) are very close to the expected 0 and 1 for the standard normal distribution.

### d. Create a histogram of the p-values. We know the null hypothesis is true, so there are two things we should expect: the p-values to follow an approximate uniform distribution and just by chance, we will reject the null $\alpha$ 100% of the time. Does this seem to be the case? How often do we reject the null? What type of error does this represent?

![Sampling P-values Histogram](https://i.imgur.com/fTXxaEq.png){ height=250px }

The p-values follow a uniform distribution. These p-values do not reject the null 90% of the time. 9.29% percent of the P-values fall below the 0.1 confidence interval.
