# ST 314 Data Analysis 2

## Part 1

### Random Variable 1

A) This is an exponential distribution as there are more people close to 0 with the amount decreasing as the time gets larger.

B) $\lambda = \frac{1}{30}$ as the mean value is given as $30$.

C) PDF:

$$
f(x) =
\begin{dcases}
    \frac{1}{30} e^{-\frac{1}{30} x} & x \geq 0 \\
    0 & otherwise \\
\end{dcases}
$$

### Random Variable 2

A) This is a uniform distribution as the buzzer has an equal likelyhood for all times between 30 and 90 seconds.

B) $a = 30$, $b = 90$

C) PDF:

$$
f(x) =
\begin{dcases}
    \frac{1}{60} & a \leq x \leq b \\
    0 & otherwise \\
\end{dcases}
$$

### Random Variable 3

A) This is a normal distribution as the distribution is symmetrical around a mean value.

B) $\mu = 3.25$, $\sigma = 0.003$

C) PDF:

$$
f(x) =
\begin{dcases}
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi(0.003)^2}} e^{- \frac{(x - 3.25)^2}{2(0.003)^2}} & -\infty \leq x \leq \infty \\
\end{dcases}
$$

## Part 2: Normal Distributions

A) $z_{10} = -1.2816$, $z_{90} = 1.2816$

B) $\mu = 253$, $\sigma = 80.3713$

C) 97% percentile value $= 404.1618$

## Part 3: Simulation of Gamma Random Variables

A) Gamma Plot

    i. PDF:

        $$
        f(x) =
        \begin{dcases}
            \frac{x e^{-x / 7}}{49} & x \geq 0 \\
            0 & otherwise \\
        \end{dcases}
        $$

    ii. Average / Standard Deviation:

        $E(X) = \alpha\beta = 2 * 7 = \bold{14}$

        $SD(X) = \sqrt{V(X)} = \sqrt{\alpha\beta^2} = \sqrt{2*7^2} = \bold{9.8995}$

    iii. $P(x \leq 4) = \text{pgamma(4, 2, rate = 1/7)} = \bold{0.1126}$

B) R-produced plot

  ![Gamma plot 1k](https://i.imgur.com/xqJvyEi.png){ height=300px }

  This curve looks like a normal and exponential distribution had a lovechild. There is a sharp increase from 0 to a peak, then a slower, almost exponential decay.

  The curve appears to fit the distribution when accounting for the spikes and dips from the generated data. Some of the data is above the curve, and some is below it, so the curve is providing the expected average value.

C) Generated proportion: 0.109

  This is fairly close to the expected from 2.A.iii: 0.1126, but the actual is slighly less with a difference of 0.0036.

$\pagebreak$

D) With 10,000 observations:

  ![Gamma plot 10k](https://i.imgur.com/5eA7PHa.png){ height=250px }

  The curve here is much closer to the real data and the data iself has much less variance. The smoother data is much closer to the expected curve.

E) Proportion with 10k samples: 0.1118

  This even closer to the expected of 0.1126, with a difference of 0.0008.

F) 10k samples with $\alpha = 1$:

  ![Gamma plot 10k, $\alpha = 1$](https://i.imgur.com/57v9pON.png){ height=250px }

  This curve / data has a very sharp peak at 0, almost like an asymptote. Most of the samples are close or very close to zero, much like an exponential distribution.

G) This gamma function is an exponential distribution. The PDF:

$$
f(x) =
\begin{dcases}
    \lambda e^{-\lambda x} & x \geq 0 \\
    0 & otherwise \\
\end{dcases}
$$
