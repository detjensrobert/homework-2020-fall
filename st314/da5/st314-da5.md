## Part 1

The `microbeersW19.csv` dataset is a representative sample of 1,244 microbrews from around the United States. The variable $abv$ represents the percent of alcohol by volume for each craft beer. According to the National Institute of Health, one standard serving of alcohol is 12 ounces of regular beer, which is usually about 5% alcohol by volume (abv).

> *Does the sample of microbrews provide evidence the average alcohol by volume of all craft beers is different from a standard serving of beer at 5% abv?*

Use this dataset and the R script `DA5_t_procedures.R` to complete the following:

### 1a. What is the parameter of interest in this scenario? Provide the symbol and context.

`microbeers$abv`

### 1b. State the null and alternative hypothesis to answer the question of interest.

$H_0:\mu = 5$

$H_a:\mu \neq 5$

### 1c. Make a histogram or boxplot to visualize the variable $abv$. Is there visual evidence the average alcohol by volume is different than 5%?

### 1d. Calculate the sample mean and standard deviation using R. State the values.

$\bar{x} = 5.90418$

$S = 1.374002$

### 1e. Check the conditions for inference. State them and whether they are met.

- **Is the data random?**
  Yes, this is a representative sample of the dataset.

- **Is the sampling distribution normal based on conditions for the CLT?**
  Yes, this sample is sufficently large for the sampling distribution to be normal.

- **Do we know $\sigma$?**
  No. We can calculate $S$ for the sample population, but we do not know $\sigma$ for the entire population.

### 1f. Calculate the test statistic by hand. Show work.

$$
t = \frac{\bar{x} - \sigma_0}{S / \sqrt{n}}
= \frac{5.9042 - 5}{1.3740 / \sqrt{1244}}
= \bold{23.2101}
$$

### 1g. State the p-value. Is it one or two sided?

Two-sided, $p = 0.000$

### 1h. Calculate the 95% Confidence Interval by hand. Show work.

$$
CI = \bar{x} \pm t_{n-1,\alpha/2} * \frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}
= 5.90418 \pm t_{1243,0.975} * \frac{1.3740}{\sqrt{1244}}
= 5.90418 \pm 1.961874 * 0.038956
= \bold{(5.8278, 5.9806)}
$$

### 1i. Use the `t.test()` command in R to verify the results of the t test. How do your answers compare?

```R
> t.test(microbeers$abv, mu = 5, alternative = 'two.sided', conf.level = .95)

        One Sample t-test

data:  microbeers$abv
t = 23.21, df = 1243, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 5
95 percent confidence interval:
 5.827753 5.980607
sample estimates:
mean of x
  5.90418
```

These results match what I calculated.

### 1j. From the R output, write a four-part conclusion describing the results. Use $\alpha = 0.05$. Provide a statement in terms of the alternative hypothesis. State whether (or not) to reject the null. Give in context an interpretation of the point and interval estimate. Include any other information you might feel to relevant.

There is sufficient evidence that the average ABV of the sampled microbeers is not 5%. We can reject the null hypothesis based on the significance level of 0.05 ($t = 23.21, df = 1243, p = 0$). The 95% confidence interval estimates the true mean of the dataset to be in the range (5.8278, 5.9806) with a best guess of 5.9042. The microbeers sampled have a higher average ABV then the standard serving.

## Part 2

The goal of this analysis is to compare the average time spent doing schoolwork during a week for ST314 students who are either in-class students (attend lectures in person) or online students (completing the course online). This data is from the combined ST314 Winter 2019 student information survey. The following software output is an analysis of this data:

![Minutes Spent Doing School Work](https://i.imgur.com/xvkeDry.png){ height=200px }

|           | Mean  | SD    | N   |
|-----------|-------|-------|-----|
| In-person | 20.31 | 17.22 | 150 |
| Online    | 18.31 | 12.67 | 67  |

Does these data provide evidence of a difference between the average time spent doing schoolwork in a week among in-class and online students? Use a significance level of 0.05 and answer the following questions using the software output.

### 2a. Describe the side-by-side boxplot. Is there visual evidence time spent doing schoolwork is different among in-class and online students? Explain your answer in 1-2 sentences.

There does not seem to be sufficient visual evidence to suggest a meaningful difference between in-person and online classes. Both boxplots share a large amount of overlap and the middle bars are close together.

### 2b. State the null and alternative hypothesis to answer the question of interest. Is the alternative one or two sided?

$H_0:\mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$

$H_a:\mu_1 - \mu_2 \neq 0$

### 2c. Check conditions for the test. State each condition and whether it is met. If not met, state why. Then continue, even if the conditions arenâ€™t met.

- **Is the data random?**
  No. This is the entire population and not a random sample of it.

- **Is the sampling distribution normal based on conditions for the CLT?**
  No. This is not a random sample.

- **Do we know $\sigma$?**
  Yes. This is the original dataset.

### 2d. From the R output, write a four-part conclusion describing the results. Provide a statement in terms of the alternative hypothesis. State whether (or not) to reject the null. Give in context an interpretation of the point and interval estimate. Make sure to provide a direction to your interval, for example, one group had a smaller (or larger) mean than the other, include this relationship in your point and interval estimate. Include any other information you might feel to relevant.

There is evidence that the time spent on work by online students is different in-person students. The null hypothesis can be rejected based on the significance level of 0.05 ($t = 0.9564, df = 168.89, p = 0.3402$). The 95% confidence interval estimates the true difference to be in the range (-2.128, 6.128) with a best guess of 2. In-person students spend 2 minutes more on school work than online students.
