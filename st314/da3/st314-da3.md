# ST 314 Data Analysis 3

## Part 1

### a. What are the average dry times for each companyâ€™s paint?

Manufacturer: 32.67

Competition: 32.80

### b. Is the manufacturers claim truthful? Either way, is the advertisement misleading? Why or why not?

This claim is partially truthful. While the average result of the provided data does show that the manufacturer's paint does dry faster than the competition, it is not wholly accurate as there are some trials where the competition dries faster. There is also the possibility of cherry-picking the best data, as discussed below.

### c. Suppose the company advertising the faster drying paint performed the experiment. Why could this be a potential problem?

Since this is a first-party benchmark, there is a conflict of interest between the manufacturer wanting to make their paint look good and providing impartial data for this experiment. The manufacturer can do any number of unethical things to the results to make their products look good, like cherry picking results, or choosing conditions to perform the experiment in that favor their product over the competition's.

## Categorical Variable

### a. Choose a categorical variable to explore. Which variable did you choose?

Phone vendor.

### b. Paste the table of counts and bar chart for the categorical variable of your choosing. Include color and an appropriate title on your plot.

| Android | iOS | Other |
|---------|-----|-------|
| 72      | 147 | 1     |

### c. Briefly, describe the distribution in context. Recall, categorical variables are summarized by counts and/or percents.

iPhones are the preferred option in this class, with about twice as many students using iPhones compared to Android.

## Quantitative Variable

### a. Choose a quantitative variable to explore. Which variable did you choose?

The number of states people have been to.

### b. Create a histogram of the variable. Include color and an appropriate title on your plot. Paste plot.

### c. Create a boxplot of the variable. Include color and an appropriate title on your plot. Paste plot.

### d. Which plot do you prefer to visualize the variable? Why?

The histogram seems to be a better fit for this data, as this data is more interesting when you can see more of the exact values instead of the data being "hidden" behind the quartile values in the box plot.

### e. Give a table that includes the mean, standard deviation, minimum, 1st quartile, median, 3rdquartile, maximum and IQR.

| Mean  | StDev | Min  | 1st Qt | Median | 3rd Qt | Max   | IQR  |
|-------|-------|------|--------|--------|--------|-------|------|
| 10.69 | 7.47  | 1.00 | 5.00   | 9.00   | 14.00  | 42.00 | 9.00 |

### f. Use the plots and summary statistics to describe the data in the context of the problem. Include the shape, center and spread in your description. State whether there are any outliers.

This data is positively skewed, towards fewer states visited. The most common number of states visited is 5, with half of the class visiting more than 10 states. There are several outliers on the high end of the data, with 7 people having visited more than 27 states.

### g. Given the shape of the data which measure, the mean, median or either, would be a more appropriate to represent the center of the data? Explain your reasoning.

The median is more representative of the data here, as the outliers who have been to many states have moved the mean away from the main peak of people.
