# ST 314 Data Analysis 1

## Part 1

### Random Variable 1

This would be a binomial distribution as there is a binary outcome not dependent on time -- either the drawer does or does not slide easily.

- n = 10 trials
- p = 0.02 probability of outcome

\begin{equation*}
p(x) = \binom{10}{x} (0.02)^x (1-0.02)^{10-x}
\end{equation*}

### Random Variable 2

This would be a Poisson distribution as this is describing the likelyhood of an event over an interval of time.

- $\lambda$ = 0.8

\begin{equation*}
p(x) = \frac{0.8^x e^{-0.8 }}{x!}
\end{equation*}

## Part 2

### a. Most likely dollar amount?

$300

### b. How likely is Bankrupt or Lose a Turn?

0.083 or 8.3%

### c. What is the average dollar amount?

This would be the expectation: (possibly off slightly due to 3-decimal rounding)

$E(X) = 300*0.208 + 350*0.042 + 400*0.083 + 450*0.042 + 500*0.125 + 550*0.042 + 600*0.125 + 700*0.042 + 800*0.083 + 900*0.083 + 5000*0.042$

**= 670.3**

### d. Suppose a contestant spins the wheel three times, how likely is it they spin $0 each time?

$P(\$0 x3) = P(\$0) * P(\$0) * P(\$0) = 0.083^3$

**= 0.00057**

### e. Suppose a contestant spins the wheel three times, how likely is it they spin $0 at least one time?

Probability of "at least once" events are found by taking the complement -- in this case, the probability of not getting $0 on all 3 trials -- and subtracting that from 1.

P($0 once in 3) = 1 - P($0 once in 3)' = 1 - P(not getting $0 in 3)

$= 1 - (22/24 * 22/24 * 22/24) = 1 - 0.77$

**= 0.230**

## Part 3

### a. What value did you spin?

350

### b. What is the average of 1000 spins?

669.55

### c. Paste the probability mass function and the plot of the probability mass function from R.

PMF Table:

| 0     | 300   | 350   | 400   | 450   | 500   | 550   | 600   | 700   | 800   | 900   | 5000  |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 0.088 | 0.213 | 0.047 | 0.079 | 0.033 | 0.113 | 0.053 | 0.132 | 0.043 | 0.076 | 0.080 | 0.043 |

### d. How different are the simulated probabilities to the theoretical probabilities in part 2?

The differences between the given p(x) and the calculated p(x):

| Value      | 0     | 300   | 350   | 400   | 450   | 500   | 550   | 600   | 700   | 800   | 900   | 5000  |
|------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Given      | 0.083 | 0.208 | 0.042 | 0.083 | 0.042 | 0.125 | 0.042 | 0.125 | 0.042 | 0.083 | 0.083 | 0.042 |
| Calculated | 0.088 | 0.213 | 0.047 | 0.079 | 0.033 | 0.113 | 0.053 | 0.132 | 0.043 | 0.076 | 0.080 | 0.043 |
| Delta      | 0.005 | 0.005 | 0.005 | 0.004 | 0.009 | 0.008 | 0.011 | 0.007 | 0.001 | 0.007 | 0.003 | 0.001 |

Most of these are within 0.005, but some are off by 26% of the expected value. With more trials, the difference between the given / theoretical data and the calculated data would decrease, eventually approaching the given data as the number of trials grows .

### e. Based on the plot is the most likely outcome the same as it is in part 2a?

Yes. 0.213 for $300 is the largest probablility for the calculated data.

### f. In general, what action will make the simulated values more like the theoretical ones?

More trials. The calculated probablilities will approach the expected / theoretical values as the number of trials approaches infinity.
