# ST 314 Data Analysis 6

## Part 1

> Single Factor ANOVA is a method we use when we want to compare a quantitative variable among more than two categories. It evaluates whether the means of different treatment groups, or populations, are equivalent. When we only have two populations then we can perform a two-sample t procedure, but when we have more populations we need to examine the data with Single Factor ANOVA.

> In the R script `DA6_Single_Factor_ANOVA.R`, follow along with the analysis that compares average number of roommates between majors for the ST314 online students. You will need to upload the student information dataset from Canvas.

> Once you have reviewed the example analysis, conduct your own by choosing one of the following three options:

> - **Option 1:** Is there evidence average number of terms a student has been studying at OSU differs between majors for ST314 students?
> - **Option 2:** Is there evidence average weekly gaming hours per week differs between majors for ST314 students?
> - **Option 3:** Is there evidence average anticipated salary differs between majors for ST314 students?

> For the option you selected, answer the questions below. Use a significance level of 0.10.

### 1a. Create side-by-side boxplot of the data and add color and a title to your plot. Paste your plot.

### 1b. From the side-by-side box plot, does there look to be a difference between the averages? Explain your reasoning.

There is definetly a difference between majors. The MechE and CS majors have noticably higher averages than the others.

### 1c. State the appropriate null and alternative hypothesis for the Single Factor ANOVA F test.

$H_0 : \mu_\text{Chem} = \mu_\text{Civil} = \mu_\text{CS} = \mu_\text{EE} = \mu_\text{IE} = \mu_\text{Mech} = \mu_\text{Other}$

$H_A :$ At least two population means differ.

### 1d. State the conditions for the Single Factor ANOVA F Test. Is it reasonable to seem that these conditions are satisfied? Explain your reasoning. (If not, still proceed.)

- Are samples random and representative of population? Yes
- Based on CLT, are $n'_I$ sufficiently large for $X'_I$ to be approx. normal? No
- Are $I$ populations independent? Yes
- Are $I$ population variances equal? No

### 1e. Perform the Single Factor ANOVA F test in R.

1. Paste the ANOVA table.

```R
             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value  Pr(>F)
Major         6   2100   350.0   3.746 0.00145 **
Residuals   213  19897    93.4
```

2. From the ANOVA table, what is the average between group variability and the average within group variability, respectively the MSTr and MSE?

    $MSTr = 350$, $MSE = 93.4$

### 1f. Use the F statistic and p-value from the ANOVA table to state whether there is a significant difference between at least two of the group means.

1. State whether to reject the null.  State the test statistic and p-value.

    There is very significant evidence that the average time spent gaming differs between majors. The null hypothesis is very strongly rejected at a significance level of $\alpha = 0.10$ with a test statistic of $F = 3.746$ and p-value $p = 0.00145$.

2. Include a statement in terms of the strength of evidence in terms of the alternative. Include context.

    Our p-value is much lower than our confidence interval. This shows that there is a large amount of evidence that there exists a meaningful difference between majors.

### 1g. Using the Tukeyâ€™s Multiple Comparison procedure output. Are there any individual comparisons that are significant at the 0.10 significance level?

1. Paste R output for the multiple comparisons procedure.

    ```R
      Tukey multiple comparisons of means
        90% family-wise confidence level

    Fit: aov(formula = GamingHours ~ Major, data = st314data)

2. List all comparisons that are significant (or state those that are not).

    CS vs. Civil has a p-value of 0.003, which is less than our significanse level.

3. Interpret the 90% F-W confidence interval for the difference with the smallest p-value (even if it is not significant).

    This shows there is a significant difference between these majors with regards to play time.
