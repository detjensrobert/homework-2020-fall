### 1. For each of the following, indicate whether $f=O(g)$, $f=\Omega(g)$ or $f=\Theta(g)$.

| Equations           |                              | Function    |
|---------------------|------------------------------|-------------|
| $f(n) = 12n-5$      | $g(n) = 1235813n+2017$       | $f = \Theta(g)$ |
| $f(n) = n\log{n}$   | $g(n) = 0.00000001n$         | $f = \Omega(g)$ |
| $f(n) = n^{2/3}$    | $g(n) = 7n^{3/4} + n^{1/10}$ | $f = O(g)$      |
| $f(n) = n^{1.0001}$ | $g(n) = n\log{n}$            | $f = \Omega(g)$ |
| $f(n) = n6^n$       | $g(n) = (3^n)^2$             | $f = \Theta(g)$ |

### 2. Prove that $\log{n!} = \Theta(n\log{n})$.  (Logarithms are based 2)

$10(n\log{n}) > \log{n!}$ --> $O(g)$

$0.2(n\log{n}) < \log{n!}$ --> $\Omega(g)$

Since there exist positive coefficients for $f(n)$ that satisfy both $O(g)$ and $\Omega(g)$, $f(n)$ satisfies $\Theta(g)$.

### 3. Write a recursive algorithm to print the binary representation of a non-negative integer.

Implemented in Ruby:

```ruby
def int_to_binary(i)
  if i <= 1
    i.to_s # .to_s == string conversion
  else
    # Ruby has integer division
    # other langs might need Math.floor(i/2) or similar instead
    int_to_binary(i / 2) + (i % 2).to_s
  end
end
```

$\pagebreak$

### 4. Describe and analyze a recursive algorithm to reconstruct an arbitrary full binary tree, given its preorder and postorder node sequences as input.

Since this is a recursive solution we need a base case. Here, that base case is when the input arrays only have one element. Just return a new node with the given value with no children.

If we are not at the base case, we need to recursively construct the tree. The first element of the pre-order array is the root value for the tree, so create a new node with that value. The second element of pre-order is the root value of the left tree. The sub-array from the start of post to that value is the post-order array of that subtree, and the same length subarray from the 2nd value of the pre-order is the subtree preorder. Make a recursive call with those subarrays to reconstruct the left tree, and set that tree to the left branch of the root node. Everything after the left root is the right branch, so recursively call with those subarrays and assign that to the right branch. Return the root node now that the branches have been constructed.

Implemented in Ruby:

```ruby
# basic class to represent a node in the tree
# has 3 properties: left, right, and value
class Node
  attr_accessor :left, :right, :value
  def initialize(value)
    @value = value
  end
end

def reconstruct_tree(pre, post)
  if pre.size == 1
    # base case: just a leaf, not a branch
    Node.new pre[0]
  else
    # recursive case
    n = Node.new pre[0] # root val is first in pre

    # next val in pre is the left root, find that in post
    left_root_index = post.index(pre[1])

    # everything up to the left root in post is the left branch
    left_pre = pre[1..left_root_index+1] # shifted by one b/c root value is first elem
    left_post = post[0..left_root_index]
    n.left = reconstruct_tree(left_pre, left_post)

    # everything after the left root is the right branch
    right_pre = pre[left_root_index+2..-1]
    right_post = post[left_root_index+1..-2] # shifted by one b/c root value is last elem
    n.right = reconstruct_tree(right_pre, right_post)

    n
  end
end
```

The runtime of this algorithm is $O(\log{n})$, as `.index` and other array methods used are  $O(n)$ but the size of the searched array is halved each recursion, much like a binary search.

The test cases I used for Q4:

```ruby

# Prints tree, but rotated 90* b/c thats easier to do
def pretty_print(node, indent=0, branch_char=' ')
  pretty_print(node.right, indent+3, '/-') if node.right
  puts ' '*indent + branch_char + node.value
  pretty_print(node.left, indent+3, '\\-') if node.left
end

puts 'Small tree:'
#      A
#    /   \
#   B     C
#        / \
#       F   G
pre  = %w(A B C F G)
post = %w(B F G C A)
pretty_print reconstruct_tree(pre, post)
# outputs correctly:
#       /-G
#    /-C
#       \-F
#  A
#    \-B

puts 'Large tree:'
#         1
#       /   \
#     2       3
#    / \     /  \
#   4   5   6    7
#  / \          / \
# 8   9       14  15
pre  = %w(1 2 4 8 9 5 3 6 7 14 15)
post = %w(8 9 4 5 2 6 14 15 7 3 1)
pretty_print reconstruct_tree(pre, post)
# outputs correctly:
#          /-15
#       /-7
#          \-14
#    /-3
#       \-6
#  1
#       /-5
#    \-2
#          /-9
#       \-4
#          \-8
```
